/**
 * Landscaping Mode vs Snow Mode.
 *
 * Two separate questions, kept apart on purpose:
 *  1. Which mode is the company in? (`companies.active_mode`, set by the owner.)
 *  2. Which modes is this person allowed into? (their own permissions.)
 *
 * The company mode only picks between the experiences a person is already
 * allowed into. It never grants access. Data access is enforced by the
 * database's row-level security, not by which screens are shown.
 *
 * Routing (snow-mode/architecture-review.md §5, decided 2026-10-15):
 *
 *   Person                    Company in Landscaping   Company in Snow
 *   Owner/admin               landscaping owner app    snow owner app
 *   Landscaping-only worker   landscaping app          "Snow Mode is on" notice
 *   Worker with snow access   landscaping app          snow worker app (a small toggle lets them step back to
 *                                                       landscaping; snow access is per worker (Snow Team)
 *                                                       when Snow Mode is switched on, until the owner removes it)
 *   Snow-only worker          snow worker app          snow worker app
 *   Customer                  landscaping app          landscaping app (snow
 *                                                       updates are added there)
