-- "Add customer" without duplicates. Before, the owner's phone looked for an existing person by email in the few people it is allowed to
-- see, so a customer who already had an account (for example at another company) was not found, and a second, unconnected person was
-- created. Now the database does it, in one step, for owner/admin only:
--
--   no email ............ a new customer record (no login). They connect later by entering a property/project code (update 70 merges).
--   same email, already in this company .. the existing person is returned; nothing new is created. A team member is refused (they are
--                         not a customer), and so is someone whose access the owner removed (reactivate them on purpose instead).
--   same email, a person with a login elsewhere .. THAT person is added to this company as an invited customer. No duplicate person.
--                         Nothing is shown to them until the owner assigns a project/property to them.
--   same email, no login anywhere .. one new customer record for this company (other companies' records are never reused or changed).
--
-- Names are never used to match. Caveat: an email address is only as trustworthy as the sign-up behind it, and email confirmation is
-- off in Supabase for now, so "the account with this email" is the person who registered that address, not a verified identity.
